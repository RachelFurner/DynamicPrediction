Both scripts use scikit learn and so rely on CPUs (scikit learn does not interface with GPUs)
Can be run interactively, or through the slurm batch queue, using the batch scripts contained here.

Python script LinearRegression_model.py creates a regression model based on various inputs, and plots the predicted results against the truth (based on a single step, generally one month), and creates stats (again based on single step predictions).

Script IterativelyForecast.py takes the truth and feeds this into the linear regressor, and then uses LR output as input to the LR to create a timeseries of forecasts iteratively. This gives us an understanding of how well the LR can do when applied iteratively over time, rather than just looking at the bias for a single step.
