# Code developed by Rachel Furner to contain modules used in developing stats/nn based versions of GCMs.
# Routines contained here include:
# ReadMITGCM - Routine to read in MITGCM data into input and output arrays, split into test and train
#                        portions of code, and normalise. The arrays are saved, and also passed back on return. 
# create_dataname - short routine to create part of an experiment name from model type and run variables.
